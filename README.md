## @randamu/conditional-encryption

A convenience library for encrypting data for the dcrypt network to dcrypt based on conditions you set.

Build everything by running `npm run build`. This creates an `index.js` and `index.d.ts` at the root directory.

Solidity interfaces for encryption and decryption can be found in the [contracts](./contracts) directory.
